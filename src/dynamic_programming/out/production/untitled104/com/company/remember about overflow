whenever returning int max or int min, make sure to not add arr[i] + rec()
it will lead to overflow ie int max + even a small value => negative value
so math.min() will give wrong ans

eg : min path sum


note that "only when returning int max or int min"
like in question knapsack we are not returning hence it is ok to add arr[i]
