we can inherit final and static methods, inherit means we can call those methods of parent
class from a child class object
but we cannot override those methods

Q)   Is final method inherited?
Ans) Yes, final method is inherited but you cannot override it. For Example:

class Bike{
  final void run(){System.out.println("running...");}
}
class Honda2 extends Bike{
   public static void main(String args[]){
    new Honda2().run();
   }
}
