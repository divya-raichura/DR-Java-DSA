Rule: If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.

Rule: If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method, you
must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.



Points to Remember :-
-   An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
-   It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
-   It needs to be extended and its method implemented.
- V.IMP.   It cannot be instantiated.
-   It can have constructors and static methods also.
-   It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the
    body of the method.
