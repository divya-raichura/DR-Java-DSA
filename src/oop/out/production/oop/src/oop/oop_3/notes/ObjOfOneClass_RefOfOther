What is the concept of creating an object of one class and referencing it with the reference variable of other class in java?

Think about it this way: all Kia Souls are cars, but not all cars are Kia Souls. I can assume that Kia Souls have all properties that are common to all cars, but I know for a fact that cars in general don't have all of the same properties as Kia Souls.

You can do something like

Car car = new KiaSoul();
but you specifically cannot do something like

KiaSoul soul = new Car();
