---->>> alt + insert == shortcut for constructor.

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.


No, constructor does not return any value. While declaring a constructor
you will not have anything like return type. In general, Constructor is
implicitly called at the time of instantiation. And it is not a method, its
sole purpose is to initialize the instance variables.
