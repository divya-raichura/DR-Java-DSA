I got confused between arraylist and array
I thought arraylist is collection of arrays like
arraylist<Integer> is collection of all int[] arr but
difference between arraylist and arrays is that both are same, just
arraylist doesn't need a fixed size but in arrays we need to give fixed size
to fill elements

also,
arraylist<arraylist<Integer>> is a collection of arraysvof int data type which
 don't require a fixed size
