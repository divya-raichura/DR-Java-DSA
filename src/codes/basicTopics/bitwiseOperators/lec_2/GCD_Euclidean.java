// The idea of this algo is, GCD of two numbers doesnâ€™t change if smaller number is
// subtracted from a bigger number. gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a-b) = gcd(b,c)  where c = a-b (a>b)
        // proof
// suppose D = gcd(a,b) -> xD = a and yD = b (because it is common divisor of a,b so something into d is a and other something into d is b)
/*
    a - b = c
    xD-yD = c
   (x-y)D = c and as x,y are some integers, x-y is also an integer
    kD = c --> so, just like xD and yD, we have kD where D = gcd(a,b) and c is just a-b
    and, as  x and y are integers, k is also integer which means teeno ka, a,b,c(a-b) ka same gcd hai


    // SIMILARLY, a + b = c then, xD + yD = c
    //  (x+y) D = c (i.e) kD = c and as x,y = integers, k is should also be integer and
    // hence if ax + by = c hota hai and kuch common nikalke 'c' divide nahi hoskta toh bucket nahi bharskte wala concept by kk


    // HENCE PROVED THAT, GCD OF A AND B = GCD OF B AND A-B (a>b)
    // gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a-b) = gcd(b,c)
    // so we can take any one of them either two nos, or smaller no and subtraction of two nos

    // hindi - D is a number is a  greatest "common" divisor of two nos a and b then it is
    //  also gcd of a-b and b (subtraction of those two nos and the smaller no)
    // matlab ek no D do nos a aur b ka highest common factor hai toh woh do nos ke subt aur dono me se
    // chote number ka bhi hcf hoga
